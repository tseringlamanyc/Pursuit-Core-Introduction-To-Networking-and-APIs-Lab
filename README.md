Status Code Scavenger Hunt!

Use Postman to find each of the following HTTP codes:


1. 200: Standard response for successful HTTP requests
1. 301: Used for permanent URL redirection, meaning current links or records using the URL that the response is received for should be updated.
1. 400: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error
1. 401: For use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided
1. 403: The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action
1. 404: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future
1. 418:  Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers
1. 500: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable


For each of the questions below, write:

1. The website which generated the HTTP status code
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/alls
2. A description of what the status code means
404Not Found - requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future
3. If an app you were writing encountered this status code, what would you do (if anything) to resolve any issues?
check the website spelling
